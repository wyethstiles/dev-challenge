A function called ‘main’ is defined
@storage object is instantiated and set to null
a while loop loops through lines of text in a text file
the strings are split by an empty space character and put into an array
a for each loop loops through the individual strings in the array
a conditional statement checks to see if the string matches a regular expression
if so, the property %t of the object @storage is incremented by 1
if not, the property %t of the object @storage is set to 1

After the while loop is done, another loop loops through all the properties in @storage and prints the values out, separated by a space with a carriage return (new line) at the end.

% is a string
$ is an array
@ is an object
